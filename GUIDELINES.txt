Coding Standards
Mainly Oracle Coding Standards
* if / for / while / switch statement: if (conditions) {
* Method: public void method() {
* No Tabs, Spaces only!
* No trailing whitespace
* Mid-statement newlines at a 150 column limit
* camelCase, no under_scores except constants
* Constants in full caps with underscores
* Keep the same formatting style everywhere
* Indents for switch statements
* No code after case *: before a new line


Pull Request Standards
* Sign-off on all commits!
* Finished product must compile and run!
* No merges should be included in pull requests unless the pull request's purpose is a merge.
* Number of commits in a pull request should be kept to one commit and all additional commits must be squashed, with the exception that pull requests that make multiple changes should have one commit per change.
* Pull requests must include any applicable license headers. (These are generated when running `mvn`)
